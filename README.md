# About ERC3525

EIP-3525 is a token standard for semi-fungible tokens. It is the first standard where a token takes both the descriptive features of a non-fungible token (NFT) and the quantitative attributes of a fungible token (FT). In other words, ERC-3525 = ERC-20 quantitative operations + ERC-721 compatibility.
